# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Presentation

## What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?

Test-Driven Development is a software development process where you:

1. **Write a failing test** that defines a function or improvement.
2. **Write the minimum amount of code** necessary to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor** the code for clarity and optimization.

This is often summarized by the **Red-Green-Refactor** loop:
- **Red**: Write a test that fails.
- **Green**: Write code to make the test pass.
- **Refactor**: Clean up the code, improving design without changing behavior.

## Why Use TDD?

- Encourages **simple design and modular code**.
- Improves **code reliability** and reduces bugs.
- Provides **living documentation** through tests.
- Helps catch errors **early**.
- Makes refactoring safer.
- Increases developer **confidence**.

## Common Mistakes in TDD

1. **Writing tests after coding** (not really TDD).
2. **Testing implementation details**, not behavior.
3. **Skipping refactoring** after tests pass.
4. **Writing large tests** before writing small units.
5. **Not automating tests** in the development workflow.

## Best Practices for TDD

- Write **small, fast tests**.
- Focus on **one behavior per test**.
- Use **descriptive test names**.
- Keep **test and production code separate**.
- Commit only **green** (passing) code.
